# BUSD_Smart-ProxyContract

BUSD token uploaded and tested on rinkbey network as another token


Proxy contracts utilize similar technology to smart contracts in that they trigger the fulfillment of predetermined conditions. However, unlike smart contracts which are immutable, proxy contracts are updatable. There's a good reason for this.

The immutability of smart contracts comes with some significant shortcomings such as the inability to fix errors or optimize fees. Proxy contracts serve as a mechanism to address these issues. They act as intermediaries and trigger the most up-to-date, optimized, and currently valid smart contract for a token.

This mechanism allows developers to upgrade the logic of a token already implemented, without needing community approval or even announcing the upgrade. This is a critical consideration for investors because assets using proxy contracts can change the current smart contract almost at any time.
